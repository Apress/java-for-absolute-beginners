Vultures
Some of us, we're hardly ever here
The rest of us, we're born to disappear
How do I stop myself from
Being just a number?
How will I hold my head
To keep from going under?
Down to the wire
I wanted water, but
I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes
To take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do
When the world keeps
Testing me, testing me, testing me
How did they find me here?
What do they want from me?
All of these vultures hiding
Right outside my door
I hear them whisperin'
They're tryin' to ride it out
They've never gone this long
Without a kill before
Down to the wire
I wanted water, but
I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes
To take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do
When the world keeps
Testing me,…
Wheels up
I got to leave this evening
Can't seem to shake these vultures
Off of my trail
Power is made by power being taken
So I keep on running
To protect my situation
Down to the wire
I wanted water, but
I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes
To take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do
When the world keeps
Testing me, testing me, testing me
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
What'cha gonna do about it?
What'cha gonna do about it?
What'cha gonna do about it?
Don't give up, give up, give up
Don't give up, give up, give up
Don't give up, give up, give up
